                By the time a family reaches out, they have usually already
                spent months, sometimes years, trying to manage the situation
                privately. They have covered bills, cleaned up messes, absorbed
                lies, believed promises, feared the worst, and argued about what
                to do next.

                In Saskatchewan, high-risk substance use, long distances, and
                harder treatment logistics outside the largest centers can all
                make families feel trapped in reaction mode.
